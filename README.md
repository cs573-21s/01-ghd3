Assignment 1 • The D3 Melodic Experience  
===

## Description 
The D3 Melodic Experience is an application that takes a melodic note and creates a abstract painting given a note. No two paintings are the same, just as no two experiences are the same when listening to a new song, album, or performance. One can look at this application as a live performancing application. Play a note and let us visualize together your experience. 

Special thanks to Mozilla Developer Network for their random integer function CSS-Tricks for their random color generator, Google fonts, Jquery, ToneJS, and ofcourse D3.

 Without you all this application would not be possible.
