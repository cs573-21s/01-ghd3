Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
Meadow Wicke


For this assignment, I decided to create a piccaso-like abstract illustration using different shapes and line functions of varying colors.
As a BCB major with a more bio-oriented background, this was my first experience with github and coding in javascript.

The abstract curves in the background are the primary colors while the shapes are a gradient of more complex colors.
I utilized svg shapes including circles, rectangles, and polygons, as well as special curve functions; curveBias, curveStep, and curveNatural.

Technical & Design Acheivements:
- Using the unique curve functions to generate the abstract basis of the piccaso-style canvas could be considered a technical acheivement. 

I referenced code from the following sites to create my illustration:
--> d3 graph gallery - Building shapes in d3.js: https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/shape.html
--> Curves - http://using-d3js.com/05_04_curves.html
