# CS573 Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  

For this first assignment, I created a simple animation of a car driving past a city with a button interaction that allows the image to shift from night to day by using JavaScript and D3.js.

## Motivation
I had originally wanted to create a still image for this assignment, but after looking through other D3.js projects I wanted to add an animation element. I referenced and drew inspiration from [this D3.js animation](https://jfire.io/animations/2014-12-27/) ([source code](https://github.com/jfirebaugh/animations/blob/master/posts/2014-12-27-moon.html)).

## Tools 
* Code: Visual Studio Code
* Prototype: GoodNotes5 with Apple Pencil

## Images
### Prototype
![Prototype image](/images/prototype.jpg)
### Night to Day animation
![Animation gif](/images/night_to_day.gif)

## Technical Achievement
* Making the buildings move indefinetly
* Changing the color of shapes from night to day with button click
* Animating the different elements of the image

## Design Achievement
* I kept the color scheme for both day and night monochromatic, with the exception of the light sources. 
* I had originally wanted everything to change colors, but realized it may be too distracting. By having the car and road stay the same, there is some consistency between the two images.
* During the night, the colors of the background go from a darker blue (sky) to a lighter blue (the moving buildings), whereas during the day, it flips and goes from a light blue (sky) to a darker blue (moving buildings).
* By having the background move, it creates the illusion of the car moving.

## For me
* Overall, I'm pretty proud of what I created. This is my first project in JavaScript and D3.js, and I have not done much work with HTML or CSS either.
* Next steps: 
    * make the car move up and down or the tires spin to really create the moving illusion
    * all of the background to move indefinetly
    * add stars in the night sky
