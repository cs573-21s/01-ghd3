Look at my project here!!: https://geacquista.github.io/01-ghd3/
I didn't use official "starter code," but I built off of examples from https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/.

Description
---
My project has everything asked for; circles, rectangles, polygons and lines (paths). I've created a simple scene, a Christmas tree with presents underneath! The circles are lights and ornaments that "turn on" when the mouse moves over it, and the polygons are the presents that are "opened" by dragging the mouse over (change from color, to brown, to white). The star "flickers" and so do the lights (also using mouseover feature)!!

-Technical Achievement Desription: I played around with different kinds of animations, ran into a few problems, but I was able to incorporate some nice transformations that did what I wanted for the picture.

-Design Achievement Description: I drew a Christmas tree!! I honestly didn't know it would come together in the end but I think it looks exactly how I pictured it, so that is my achievement.
