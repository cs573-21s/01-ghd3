Design/Technical Achievements/Notes
---
* Functionality related
  * One piece captures
  * Clicking on a piece will hold it with the mouse
  * Pieces are removed from board upon being captured
  * Pieces move as checker pieces do
  * King promotions exist
  * Player score is shown at bottom and winner will be displayed
  * Pieces are stored on an 8x8 array. The piece held by the cursor is stored as a temporary variable. When the piece is placed, the board array is updated.
* Stylistic
  * Checkerboard grid using svg
  * Polygons for lighting/design effect
  * Colors were selected from https://www.color-hex.com/
* Animation related
  * Hovering a MOVABLE piece (if itâ€™s your turn), leads to a highlight animation. Moving the mouse away means the highlight will fade away
  * Line tracer follows mouse and shows initial position of piece picked up. When a piece is placed in a new square, the line shows the path between old and new locations.
  * Color of piece changes after becoming a king
  * Opacity of piece changes when piece is held
