## Description
This is Junying Li's solution for assignment 1. It contains 6 kinds of graphics primitives (circles, rectangles, lines, polygons, ellipses, polylines) in different colors and some of them have stroking. Each of these primitives has an example drawn on the left top of this page. By using these graphics primitives, I designed a beautiful Christmas tree in snow. There's a snow animation and shiny lights decorated on the Christmas tree. Also, user can play background music by clicking the play music button and pause it by clicking pause music button. In addition, when mouseover bulbs(circles) on the Christmas tree, someone will say Merry Christmas to user (autometically play voice audio). All bulbs(circles) on the Christmas tree are marked by small red arrows as you can see below in Screenshot 2. Audios need some time to load, please wait for a sec if the audio cannot be played.

Here are two screenshots of my page.

## Section for Technical and Design Achievements
### Technical achievements
1. It contains 6 kinds of graphics primitives in defferent colors.
2. Snow animation and shiny light animation using `transition()`.
3. Play audio by `play()` method.
### Design achievements
1. Draw a Christmas tree by using basic graphics primitives.
2. Watching the snow animation can help users release stress.
3. Users can play Christmas music.
4. When mouseover bulbs(circles) on Christmas tree, it will autometically play voice audio of Merry Christmas from woman, little boy, Santa Claus and The Jackson 5.
