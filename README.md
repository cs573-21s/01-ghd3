Description

I've created a simple scene, a Christmas tree with presents underneath! The circles are lights and ornaments that "turn on" when the mouse moves over it, and the polygons are the presents that are "opened" by dragging the mouse over (change from color, to brown, to white). The star "flickers" and so do the lights (also using mouseover feature)!! There's some animation when the page first opens

I didn't use official "starter code," but I built off of examples from https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/.
