Link: http://evelyntrvn.github.io/01-ghd3/index.html

For this first assignment, I attempted to recreate a moving car with D3.js by drawing static shapes, having a moving background, and a button to change the colors from night to day. I referenced [this D3.js animation](https://jfire.io/animations/2014-12-27/) ([source code](https://github.com/jfirebaugh/animations/blob/master/posts/2014-12-27-moon.html)).
