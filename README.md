I used the in class demo as a starting point for the assignment. In addition I used the following sites for reference on how to create graphics primitives.

Technical Achievement Desription
---

I have never worked in d3 or JavaScript and only a very little in Terminal and GitHub, so it was a technical achievement for me to get up to speed on those things. I made interactive elements on the circles and rectangles, changing size, fill color, and stroke on mouse over. I also used a transition for the fill of the polygons to change on opening.  

Design Achievement Description
---

I played around with placement, size, color, and opacity of the graphics primitives to make the assignment visually interesting. I wanted to make a curved line and was originally going for a wave. But my first attempt at a wave looked like it might make a cool abstract frog head. So I added the polygons to do that.
