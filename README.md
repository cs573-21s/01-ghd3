For Assignment 1, I decided to make a simple, online Whack-a-Mole (in my version, you are whacking circles!). To play, select a difficulty, and then press the "Play the Game" button. Click on the circles before they dissapear to score points! And watch out, on higher difficulties, the shapes move across the screen.

After playing my own game, I have come to the conclusion that clicking on 2d shapes is not quite as satisfying as hitting animatronics with a hammer... Oh well... 

The "Make Pretty Shapes" button is only there to prove that I can make rectangles, lines, and polygons :)

Technical Achievements
---

1. Animation of shapes - depending on the difficulty level, shapes were animated both in color and x/y position.
2. Interaction with shapes - when you click a shape, I remove it from the svg and increment your score.

Design Achievments
---

1. Game - I made an interactive, and kind of fun game to play. A High Score encourages players to return for another try.
2. Difficulty levels - Whack-a-Shape can be played by people of all skill levels.
3. Changing Colors - changing colors from green to yellow and then to red helps players realize how long they have to click on that circle.
