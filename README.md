Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===

Description:

For this project, I used d3 to replicate the rocket on a WPI TouchTomorrow advertisement using circles, rectangles, lines and polygons

To design the project, I used code I found from the following d3 tutorials:

https://lucidar.me/en/d3.js/part-06-basic-shapes/

Technical Achievement:
I was able to get all the shapes that I used (circles, polygons, and rectangles) in the correct positions on the webpage to form the rocket and only ended up with minute differences between my image and the original.

Design Achievement:

I was able to replicate rocket almost exactly with only slight differences between mine and the actual image with all the correct colors.
