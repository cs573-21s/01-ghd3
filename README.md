## Description
This is Junying Li's solution for assignment 1. It contains 6 kinds of graphics primitives (circles, rectangles, lines, polygons, ellipses, polylines) in different colors and some of them have stroking. Each of these primitives is drawn on the left top. By using these graphics primitives, I designed a Christmas tree. Users can light up the bulbs on this tree by mouseover them. 
There are some webpages where I learn SVG and D3 from.
